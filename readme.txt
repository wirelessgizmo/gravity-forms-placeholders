Adds HTML5 placeholder support to Gravity Forms' fields with a Javascript fallback. Javascript & jQuery are required.

Note: This repo is forked from https://github.com/neojp/gravity-forms-placeholders/ which is used as a base for some of the front end JS and inspired me to create this version.

== Description ==

Adds HTML5 placeholder support for Gravity Forms fields by adding an extra field type in the Advanced tab.

Currently only supports the Text field but more will be added shortly. Includes JS fallback.
